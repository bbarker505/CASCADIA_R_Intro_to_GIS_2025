Combine the [`terra`](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html),
[`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), and
[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) packages to work with
geospatial data and create beautiful maps.

### __Learning objectives__

-   Plot and analyze spatial data to address a research question
-   Apply different mapping functions in `terra`, `sf`, and `ggplot2`
-   Describe the difference between vector and raster features
-   Describe the influence of a coordinate reference system (CRS) on
    mapping
-   Adjust `ggplot2` settings to customize maps

## __Mapping predicted vs. observed dates of lilac phenophases__

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "NPN_phenophase.jpg"))
```

In the following exercises, we will visualize spatial concordance
between model-predicted and observed dates of lilac leaf out, which is a
phenophase of lilac in which new leaves appear. A **phenophase** is an
observable stage of an animal's or plant's life cycle that can be
defined by a start and end point. All data were derived from the [USA
National Phenology
Network](https://www.usanpn.org/usa-national-phenology-network), an
organization that hosts phenology models and maintains a database of
volunteer-contributed observations of phenology for ecologically and
economically important species of plants and insects in the USA.

------------------------------------

## __Exercise 1: Mapping predicted lilac leaf out__

We import raster data for model predictions of lilac leaf out for 2018
using the `rast()` function in `terra`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
lilacModel_r <- rast(here("data", "lilac_2018_model.tiff"))
```

Check out attributes of the raster, such as it's class, coordinate
reference system (crs), class, extent, and range of values correspond to
the day in which lilac leaf out was predicted to occur in `2018`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
class(lilacModel_r)
lilacModel_r
```

We'll go over three approaches for mapping this raster.

#### __(1a) terra: `plot()`__

The raster can be visualized using the [`plot()` function in
`terra`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/plot.html). This
function can produce some decent looking maps, but not as nice as
`ggplot2` maps (in my opinion). Try it out below.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Plot the raster
plot(lilacModel_r)
```

The color palette can changed using the `col` option. The default is
`rev(grDevices::terrain.colors(50))`. Can you find a palette that you
like better? (e.g., check out other palettes in `viridis` by typing
`viridis::`).

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Continuous prediction using a different color palette
plot(lilacModel_r, col = rev(viridis::viridis(50)))
```

Raster data can be depicted in bins by specifying "interval" for the
`type` option. The number of intervals is defined with the `breaks`
option. Apply different numbers of breaks to see how it affects your
map.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Binned predictions 
plot(lilacModel_r, type="interval", breaks = 8, col = rev(viridis::viridis(8)))
# The legend falls off the map!
```

You can also classify the bins yourself using the `classify()` function.
Try changing the `classes` object in the code below to see how it
impacts the map.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# How should you define your bins?
classes <- seq(0, 230, 20)
# Now classify the raster
lilacModel_r2 <- classify(lilacModel_r, classes)
# Plot the results as before, except add `type="classes"` to the function
plot(lilacModel_r2, type="classes", col = rev(viridis::viridis(length(classes))))
```

------------------------------------

__Question 1.__ How does predicted lilac leaf out vary
across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS)? Any ideas what may explain these
patterns?

Answer: Leaf out occurs earlier in southern latitudes because warmer
temperatures there drive faster development.

------------------------------------

The `plot()` function has several other options for customizing maps.
Below, I added a title, put axis labels on 3 sides.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
plot(lilacModel_r, 
     type="interval", 
     breaks = 8, 
     col = rev(viridis::viridis(8)),
     plg=list(title="Predicted\nLeafout DOY", cex=0.9), pax=list(side=1:3))
```

#### __(1b) Plotting rasters in ggplot2__

Most people are more familiar with tidyverse packages and functions than
those in `terra` or its predecessor `raster`. Thus, mapping rasters with
`ggplot2` is often preferred over `plot()`. We'll cover two `ggplot2`
functions: (1) `geom_raster()`, which requires data to be in data frame
format, and (2) `geom_spatraster()`, which can work directly with
`SpatRaster` objects. The latter function is part of the relatively new
[`tidyterra` package](https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/). For both
examples, days of the year will be binned into months to facilitate
comparisons with observed lilac leaf out dates (Exercise 2, below). This
task requires defining a factor variable, as described below.

#### __ggplot2: `geom_raster()`__

First, convert the raster into a data frame using `as.data.frame()` in
`terra.` Set the `xy` option to `TRUE` to retain coordinate information
(`x` and `y` columns), and rename the data column from `layer` to
`leaf_doy.`

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Convert raster data to a data frame 
lilacModel_df <- lilacModel_r %>%
  as.data.frame(xy = TRUE) %>%
  rename("leaf_doy" = layer)
head(lilacModel_df)
```

Next, we create a data frame that specifies the month for each day of
year, which will be used for defining factor levels and for plotting in
`ggplot2`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Data frame needed to create pretty plots
factors_df <- data.frame(
  # Day and month of year
  leaf_doy= 1:365, 
  leaf_month = cut_interval(1:365, 12)) %>%
  # Bin dates by month and re-format labels to remove brackets, parentheses, etc.
  mutate(leaf_month = format(as.Date(
    leaf_doy, origin = "2018-01-01"), "%b"),
    leaf_month = gsub("\\(|\\]|\\[", "", leaf_month)) %>%
  mutate(leaf_month = gsub(",", "-", leaf_month))

# Convert month to a factor so they're in the right order on plots
# Factor levels are ordered by day of the year
factors_df$leaf_month <- factor(
  factors_df$leaf_month, 
  levels = unique(factors_df$leaf_month[order(factors_df$leaf_doy)]))
```

Join the data frame with factor levels to `lilacModel_df` and examine
its structure. To do this, use `left_join()` from the `dplyr` package.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Join month labels to lilac predictions
lilacModel_df <- left_join(lilacModel_df, factors_df, by = "leaf_doy") 
head(lilacModel_df)
```

Next, we create some custom labels for the plots, and define a pretty
color palette.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Create a vector of labels to show in plot legend
labs <- unique(factors_df$leaf_month)

# Create a color palette (vector) for the plot 
pal <- c("#1f83b4", "#12a2a8", "#2ca030", "#78a641", "#bcbd22", "#ffbf50",
         "#ffaa0e", "#ff7f0e","#d63a3a", "#c7519c", "#ba43b4", "#8a60b0")
names(pal) <- unique(factors_df$leaf_month) # Name colors by month
```

Finally, the `lilacModel_df` data frame can be plotted using
`geom_raster()`.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Create a map using ggplot2
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) 
```

This map looks okay but can definitely be improved. For example, we
could add a plot title, custom legend title, and maybe get rid of the
default gray background, grid lines, and axes labels. First add the
titles.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Create a map using ggplot2
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Predicted First\nLeaf Out", label = labs, values = pal) +
  ggtitle("Month of Predicted First Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") 
```

Now customize the map theme. If you're producing multiple plots, it's
more concise to define your custom theme a single time (DRY principle =
Don't Repeat Yourself).

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Custom theme
my_theme <- theme(#panel.grid= element_blank(),
                 panel.background = element_blank(), 
                 panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA),
                 axis.title = element_blank(), 
                 #axis.text = element_blank(),
                 #axis.ticks = element_blank(),
                 plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
                 legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                 legend.title = element_text(face="bold", size = 12),
                 legend.text = element_text(size = 11),
                 legend.key.height = unit(0.0025, "cm"),
                 legend.key.width = unit(1, "cm"))
```

Apply the custom theme to the plot.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Create a map using ggplot2
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Predicted First\nLeaf Out", label = labs, values = pal) +  
  ggtitle("Month of Predicted First Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") +
  my_theme # Our custom theme
```

------------------------------------

__Challenge 1.__ Change at least two plot features to
align with your preferences. For example, you could remove the plot axes
(lat and long), change the legend attributes, font types and sizes, etc.
(`my_theme`), or change the color palette (`pal`).

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}

```

------------------------------------

FYI: The [`ggsn`](https://oswaldosantos.github.io/ggsn/) package has
functions to add a scale bar and north arrow. Check it out sometime!

#### __Adding boundary data to maps__

The map is more informative if we add state boundaries. Some R packages
provide these data, including
[`rnaturalearth`](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth) and
[`USAboundaries`](https://docs.ropensci.org/USAboundaries/); however,
installing them can sometimes be problematic. To avoid troubleshooting,
I saved USA boundary data as shapefiles. First, we need to use
`st_use_s2(FALSE)` because `sf` assumes the world is round, and uses
great circles for straight lines. This will cause issues for cropping
boundaries to the same extent as our raster data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
sf_use_s2(FALSE)

```

Now import the shapefile using the `st_read()` function and plot the
first column.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# US states feature
states <- st_read(here("data", "states.shp"))
# Plot the first data column
plot(states[1])
```

------------------------------------

__Question 2.__ What is the class and geometry type of
`states`? Describe two other differences between `states` and
`lilacModel_r`.

Answer: the class is both `sf` and `data.frame`. The `sf` portion
contains geographic information such as geometry, extent, and CRS,
whereas the data frame has associated data, such as state names and
abbreviations. In contrast, `lilcModel_r` is raster data contained in a
`SpatRaster` object. The raster data are gridded and cover the entire
CONUS, whereas the sf data are a vector of state boundaries. The two
datasets are similar in that they have a CRS, a geographic extent, and
spatial information.

------------------------------------

We're going to run into issues due to differing coordinate reference
systems (CRS) of `states` and `lilacModel_r`. You can see these
differences by using the `crs()` function on both objects.

CRS of `states`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# CRS of states
crs(states)
```

CRS of `lilacModel_r`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# CRS of lilacModel_r
crs(lilacModel_r)
```

Change the CRS of states to match the raster data using `st_transform`.
Check out the results.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Transform coordinates of states
states <- st_transform(states, crs(lilacModel_r))
crs(states)
```

Next, use `st_crop()` to crop your states feature to the same extent as
your raster, which is CONUS. Check out the results. What happens if you
skip the `st_transform()` step and run this code?

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Crop to CONUS
states_c <- st_crop(states, lilacModel_r)
# Plot the result
plot(states_c[1])
```

------------------------------------

__Challenge 2.__ Can you think of a `dplyr` approach
to obtaining data only for CONUS? Hint: remove rows with undesired
states (note that Puerto Rico \[PR\] is in the data).

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
states_c2 <- filter(states, !stusps %in% c("AK", "HI", "PR"))
plot(states_c2[1])
```

------------------------------------

Finally, use `geom_sf()` to add an `sf` object to a plot - i.e., the
states feature.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Add an 'sf' object to them map
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) +
  geom_sf(data = states_c, fill = NA) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Predicted First\nLeaf Out", label = labs, values = pal) +
  ggtitle("Month of Predicted First Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") +
  my_theme
```

------------------------------------

__Question 3.__ What happens when you don't enter `NA`
for the fill option for the `states_c` feature? Why?

Answer: the states features covers up the raster data because it's
multi-polygon data. The default fill color is gray.

------------------------------------

You could just continue to use fill = `NA`, or convert the geometry of
`states_c` to `MULTILINESTRING` using the `st_cast()` function.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Convert geometry from polygon to multilinestring 
states_c %>%   
  st_cast("MULTILINESTRING")  
```

You can add labels to your map using the `geom_sf_text()` or
`geom_sf_label()` functions. State abbreviations can be shown by
selecting "stusps" as the `label` in the `aes()` function.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Add labels to the states feature
ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) +
  geom_sf(data = states_c, fill = NA) +
  geom_sf_text(data = states_c, aes(label = stusps), size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Predicted First\nLeaf Out", label = labs, values = pal) +
  ggtitle("Month of Predicted First Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") +
  my_theme
```

#### __ggplot2: `geom_raster()`__

An identical map can be produced using the `geom_spatraster()` function
in `tidyterra`, which works directly with `SpatRaster` objects. First,
create a copy of your raster and convert the data into categorical
(factor) format for plotting. The `factors_df` data frame is used to
define factor levels.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Define factor levels of the raster using the "factors_df" data frame
lilacModel_r2 <- lilacModel_r
levels(lilacModel_r2) <- factors_df
```

Look at both rasters and notice the data formats.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Original raster (numeric data - days of the year)
lilacModel_r
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# New raster (categorical data - months of the year)
lilacModel_r2
```

Create the same map as before but instead use `geom_spatraster()` with
your categorical raster instead of `geom_raster()`.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plot produced using "geom_spatraster"
conus_mod <- ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = lilacModel_r2, aes(fill = leaf_month))  +
  geom_sf(data = states_c, fill = NA) +
  geom_sf_text(data = states_c, aes(label = stusps), size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Predicted First\nLeaf Out", 
                    label = labs, values = pal, na.value = "white") +
  ggtitle("Month of Predicted First Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") +
  my_theme

conus_mod
```

Save your map using `ggsave()` and see how it looks. If you're not happy
with it, adjust the image dimensions of change the plot theme (i.e.,
`my_theme`).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Change the object name if needed
ggsave(conus_mod, filename = here("plots", "Lilac_leaf_out_model_2018.png"), 
       dpi = 300, units = c('in'), width = 10, height = 6)
```

------------------------------------

## __Exercise 2: Adding phenometric data to the map__

We can add more layers to our map to ask certain questions, such as: How
do model-predicted dates of lilac leaf out compared with observed dates?
Below, we import phenometric data for observed lilac leaf out dates for
2018. These data were collected by volunteers and submitted to the USA
National Phenology Network's database.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Phenometric data
lilacObs_df <- read.csv(here("data", "lilac_2018_obs.csv"))
```

Take a look at the data dimensions. How many observations are there?

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
dim(lilacObs_df)
```

There are 77 unique sites in the dataset. The goal is to add the
location for each observation to our previous map.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
length(unique(lilacObs_df$site_id))
```

We only need data in three columns in the phenometric data: `longitude`,
`latitude`, and `first_yes_doy`. The `first_yes_doy` column specifies
the day of year when first lilac leaf out was observed. We'll subset the
columns using `select()` and take a look at the first several rows of
data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
lilacObs_df <- lilacObs_df %>%
  filter(state != "ON") %>% # Remove an observation from Canada
  dplyr::select("longitude", "latitude", "first_yes_doy") %>%
  rename("leaf_doy" = "first_yes_doy") %>% 
  left_join(factors_df, by = "leaf_doy") 
```

Take a look at the first several rows of data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
head(lilacObs_df)
```

For plotting purposes, we convert the phenometric data to a simple
feature (`sf`) object using the
[`st_as_sf()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/1.0-9/topics/st_as_sf)
function. You must specify which columns contain the coordinates, and
also define the CRS, which should be the same as our other objects.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Convert data frame to a simple feature
lilacObs_sf <- lilacObs_df %>%
   st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = crs(states))
```

We'll save the file for use in the next exercise. The extension `.shp`
makes it save as an ESRI Shapefile. Note: GDAL requires that column names
are \<=10 characters long.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Shorten names
names(lilacObs_sf) <- c("leaf_doy", "leaf_month", "geometry")
st_write(lilacObs_sf, here("data", "lilac_2018_obs.shp"), append = TRUE)
```

Compare the geometry of `lilacObs_sf` and `states`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Lilac observations feature
lilacObs_sf$geometry
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# States feature
states$geometry
```

------------------------------------

__Question 4.__ How does the geometry of the lilac
observations (`lilacObs_sf`) differ from the states feature? Why?

Answer: the lilac observations have a POINT geometry whereas the states
data have a MULTIPOLYGON geometry. Observations are from single
locations, whereas state boundaries cover many points over the U.S.

------------------------------------

Now let's add the phenometric data so we can visualize spatial
concordance between model-predicted and observed dates for first leaf
out. Sites for each observation are plotted using their coordinate
information and colored according to values in the `leaf_date`
column.

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width=9.5}
# Add sites to the map
conus_modVobs <- ggplot() + 
  #geom_spatraster(data = lilacModel_r, aes(fill = leaf_month))  +
  geom_raster(data = lilacModel_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = leaf_month)) +
  geom_sf(data = states_c, fill=NA) +
  geom_sf(data = lilacObs_sf, aes(color = leaf_month), 
          size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data = lilacObs_sf, color = "black", 
          size = 3, shape = 1) + # black outlines around sites
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Month of First\nLeaf Out", 
                    label = labs, values = pal, drop = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Month of First\nLeaf Out", 
                     label = labs, values = pal, drop = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs. Observed 1st Leaf Out in Lilac in 2018") +
  my_theme
conus_modVobs
```

Save your map using `ggsave()` and see how it looks. If you're not happy
with it, adjust the image dimensions or change the plot theme (i.e.,
`my_theme`).

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
ggsave(conus_modVobs, 
       filename = here("plots", "Lilac_leaf_out_modelVsObs_2018.png"), 
       dpi = 300, units = c('in'), width = 10, height = 6)
```

------------------------------------

__Question 5.__ What does your map tell you about
predicted vs. observed first leaf out in lilac? Can you think of a
better way to compare the two datasets on a map?

Answer: Our map indicates that predicted dates of lilac leaf out in 2018
did not always correspond to observed dates. In some cases, the model
seems to under-predict dates (leaf out too early) whereas in others it
over-predicts (leaf out too late). Notice that two sites had dates that
were much later than predicted dates. In this case, perhaps the
volunteers failed to notice that lilac leaf out had already occurred,
although other explanations are possible.

------------------------------------

#### __Combining different maps__

Let's say we're interested in results for a particular region of CONUS,
such as a state. The map can be zoomed with the `coord_sf()` function,
in which the x- and y-limits of the region are defined. In the commented
`coord_sf()` function below, enter your own limits (xmin, xmax, ymin,
ymax), but make sure they're within the U.S.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Define your limits
# Min must go before max (e.g., -180, 180)
xcoords <- c(-90.5542, -82.3047)
ycoords <- c(41.6311, 47.5739)

# Map for specific region
# The expand = FALSE ensures that limits are taken exactly as provided
conus_modVobs +
  # Define x- and y-limits
    coord_sf(xlim = xcoords, ylim = ycoords,
             expand = FALSE) 
```

We can also add county boundaries by importing the shapefile in the data
folder (`./data/counties.shp`). Remember to change the CRS as we did
above for `states`. Also, feel free to convert the geometry to
`MULTILINESTRING`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Simple feature ("sf") for US counties
counties <- st_read(here("data", "counties.shp"))
counties <- counties %>%
  st_transform(crs = crs(states)) %>%
  st_cast("MULTILINESTRING") 
```

Add the counties to your map below, remove the legend and title, and
make any other desired changes. Give the map a name so it can be used
for the next step.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Map for region of interest
# Lilac leaf out observations are added again so boundary lines don't cover them
zoom_modVobs <- conus_modVobs +
  geom_sf(data = counties, fill = NA, color = "gray30", size = 0.25) + # Add counties
  geom_sf(data = lilacObs_sf, aes(color = leaf_month), 
          size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-90.5542, -82.3047), 
           ylim = c(41.6311, 47.5739),
           expand = FALSE) + # Take limits exactly as defined
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        plot.title = element_blank())
zoom_modVobs
```

Finally, we can combine maps for CONUS and your region of interest using
the [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) package. The
`\` operator indicates that the map for CONUS goes on top of the region
map, the width setting indicates that the CONUS is map is 2X bigger, and
the legend is "collected" to ensure it stays in the correct position (on
right-hand side).

```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width=9.5}
# Combine maps using patchwork (ToDo - this still doesn't run [Roger])
both_modVobs <- conus_modVobs / zoom_modVobs +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect", widths = c(2, 1))
both_modVobs
```

Save your map and see what you think. Feel free to adjust the theme,
plot dimensions, or anything else to improve the map.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
ggsave(both_modVobs, 
       filename = here("plots", "Lilac_leaf_out_modelVsObs_2018_2.png"), 
       dpi = 300, units = c('in'), width = 9, height = 9)
```

Note: Other options for combining plots include functions in the
[`ggpubr`](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) \[`ggarrange()`\] and
[`cowplot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html)
\[`plot_grid()`\] packages.

## __Exercise 3: Extract and analyze raster data__

There are numerous functions in `terra` for extracting, manipulating,
and analyzing raster data. Here, we'll use the `extract` function to
extract model predictions (predicted day of year) from the precise
location where lilac observations were collected (observed day of year).
This allows us to further compare the two datasets.

Extract the predictions, convert results to a data frame, and rename the
data column from `layer` to `leaf_doy`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Extract model predictions for each observation location
lilacObs_extr <- extract(lilacModel_r, lilacObs_sf) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename("leaf_doy" = "layer") %>%
  as.data.frame() 
```

Next, we can estimate the extent to which the model under-predicts vs.
over-predicts the date of lilac leaf out by subtracting the
`leaf_doy` columns.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Differences (in days) between predicted and observed lilac leaf out
differences <- lilacObs_extr$leaf_doy- lilacObs_sf$leaf_doy
```

Create a histogram of differences using the `hist()` function in base
`R.`

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
hist(differences, breaks = seq(-250, 50, 25))
```

Now calculate some simple summary statistics of the differences.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}
# Mean
mean(differences)
# Range
range(differences)
# Median
median(differences)
```

------------------------------------

__Question 6.__ What information do your simple
analyses provide that can't be seen on a map? Overall, what do the
results say about the performance of the model for lilac leaf out?

Answer: On average, predicted dates were 13.71 days earlier (range =
-237 to 48 days) than observed dates, which suggests that the model is
under-predicting the date of lilac leaf out. However, the extreme
outliers are likely due to observer error, as we noted above. The model
actually seems to perform pretty well if we reduce the impact of
outliers by calculating the median difference, which is only 1 day.

------------------------------------

## __Wrap-up__

These exercises only scratched the surface of mapping in R! Here's a
summary:

-   `terra` is the most important `R` package for working with rasters:

    -   `plot()` can produce maps but I prefer `ggplot2` functions for
        "final" (publication-quality) mapping

    -   Numerous functions for extracting, manipulating, and analyzing
        raster data

    -   Methods for manipulating data in vector form

-   `ggplot2` has several functions for plotting rasters including:

    -   `geom_raster()` or `geom_tile()`: require a data frame

    -   `geom_spatraster()`: requires a SpatRaster object

    -   `geom_stars()`: uses the `stars` package, which was not covered
        here
